# VinMonitor
A C# Software which provides an interface to display Vinted announces searched by the user using Vinted API.
VinMonitor helps the user be faster than others by loading new announcements slightly before they appear on the Vinted website. 

Features : searches with keywords such as brand, pricerange, or condition of the item through the whole Vinted website.

An automated mode is built in : the user can set the delay within each search is refreshed.
The announces are displayed on the monitor with the seller info and a link which redirects to the announce page on the Vinted website.
